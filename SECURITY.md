- [x] Removed test scripts with sensitive data
- [x] Proper error messages (no sensitive info leaked)
- [x] Input validation on all forms

## 🚨 Security Warnings

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Update These Before Production

1. **JWT Secret**: Change the default JWT secret in production
2. **Database URL**: Use your actual Neon database URL
3. **Admin Password**: Change the default admin password
4. **Environment**: Set `NODE_ENV=production`

### 🔧 Required Actions

1. **Create `.env.local`** with your actual credentials:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="your-actual-neon-url"
   JWT_SECRET="your-32-character-random-secret"
   ADMIN_EMAIL="your-admin-email"
   ADMIN_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
   ```

2. **Generate Strong JWT Secret**:
   ```bash
   node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
   ```

3. **Change Default Admin Password**:
   - Login to admin panel
   - Go to Settings > Security
   - Update password to something strong

## 🛡️ Additional Security Recommendations

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Enable HTTPS
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Database backup strategy

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts
- [ ] Log security events
- [ ] Set up alerts for suspicious activity

## 🔍 Security Audit

### Files Checked
- ✅ `lib/db/config.js` - No hardcoded URLs
- ✅ `lib/db/services/auth-service.js` - No hardcoded secrets
- ✅ `drizzle.config.js` - No hardcoded URLs
- ✅ `app/api/auth/*` - Secure authentication
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Environment files ignored
- ✅ Test scripts - Removed sensitive data

### Potential Vulnerabilities
- ⚠️ Default admin credentials (change before production)
- ⚠️ JWT secret in environment (ensure it's strong)
- ⚠️ Database connection (ensure it's secure)

## 📞 Security Contact

If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please:
1. Do not create public issues
2. Contact the development team privately
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes before disclosure
